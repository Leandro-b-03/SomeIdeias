# Grid
<p class="lead">The grid is responsible for basic element positioning.</p>

### How to use
The grid is a third party [postCSS plugin](https://github.com/corysimmons/lost).

The idea behind this concept is the flexibility to add just what you need. Instead of making the decision of providing a semantic/non-semantic responive grid system (which adds a big chunk of code), you can easily provide a bit of sugar to create a set of classes to handle it.
